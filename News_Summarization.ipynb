            " Harshita Brella (24) was found dead in the boot of her husband’s car at Brisbane Road in East London. The suspect in the case, her husband Pankaj Lamba, is yet to be found. Her family has filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court, which sought a status report. The case will next be heard on March 24. The Delhi Police, however, said it is awaiting sanction from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and Letters Rogatory and Mutual Legal Assistance is pending with the Director, Prosecution, at Tis Hazari Court. The matter is sub-judice, the Delhi Police and the MHA said, “The matter isSub-Judice” and the report is still awaited. The Northamptonshire Police have named Lamba as the prime suspect. They claim he has fled the country. The family filed a complaint at the Palam Village police station accusing her husband, in-laws and other relatives of cruelty and demanding dowry. A post-mortem examination at the Leicester Royal Infirmary on November 15 listed strangulation as the preliminary cause of death. The court, in its order, said expeditious steps should be taken by the law-enforcement agencies concerned to ascertain whether Harshita”s husband is in India, as alleged by the Brella family. ‘The information regarding Lamba having travelled from London to Mumbai and Delhi be also verified and appropriate steps be taken to trace the said individual,’ it said in its January 31 order. “Either the Central Bureau of Investigation or any other investigative agency should take up this case,” she said. The only ray of hope is that the matter is being heard in the HC; we are optimistic that justice will be served,“ said Sonia Dabas, the sister of the victim, who has sought an inquiry from an independent agency. She said: “We want justice to be served.”\n"
